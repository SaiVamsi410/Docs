Notification of Address
Functional Description
Introduction
•	Legacy systems notifications will be processed by Database batch processes.
•	Database will accept notifications from both legacy and non-legacy systems.
Purpose
•	Database release 2 will receive T008 Address Notification .
•	Describes the process, data, and tables modified by this notification.
•	Changes in DATABASE data will trigger outbound broadcasts to other systems.
•	Outbound broadcasts represent the 'final picture' of data for that day.
•	Duplicate notifications of the same data on the same day will not trigger broadcasts.
•	Inbound notifications accepted from any system in the notification network.
•	Batch job updates customer address records or ends them (creating a DLO status).
•	QAS matching and de-duplication process performed on address records.
Process
Validation Rules	Description
Notifications must have correct format.	Validate NI Number.
Data must be complete and correct.	Check address formatting, avoid duplicates, valid words.
Invalid data will be rejected.	Verify address start/end dates, consecutive punctuation.
•	Address type defaults to Permanent Residential.
•	Customer role key defaults to default DATABASE Role.
•	Address status type defaults based on notification content.

•	Failed validations result in record rejection.
•	No rejection message sent back to source system.
•	Rejected records managed by Application Live Support Team.
Matching and De-duplication
•	Initial Matching: Compare incoming addresses with DATABASE records.
•	Create new records for non-matching addresses.
•	Update CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table for matched addresses.
•	QAS Process: Clean up new addresses and remove duplicates.
•	Assign appropriate FAX_CODE_TYPE based on address type.
•	Foreign addresses assigned specific FAX_CODE_TYPE.
Update Process
•	Update ADDRESS and CUSTOMER_ADDRESS tables with file data.
•	Populate fields based on input file and technical audit data.
Address Matching and Insertion Rules
Step	Description
1.3.15	Match on first 7 characters of line 1, first 6 characters of line 2, and Pincode for an exact match.
1.3.16	Incoming file with null end date is processed.
1.3.17	Compare address lines and Pincode with ADDRESS table.
1.3.18	If fields match exactly with a PAF compliant address, no new address is created.
1.3.19	If fields do not match exactly or match with a Non-PAF Compliant address, a new address is created.
1.3.20	For matched records, no new entries are added to the ADDRESS table.
1.3.21	For unmatched records, new entries are inserted into the ADDRESS table with specific conditions.

Conditions for Inserting Records into ADDRESS Table:
Table	Column	Change	Condition
ADDRESS	Address_Key	Insert	Unique Random Number generated for address key
ADDRESS	Address_Line_1	Insert	Valid address line
ADDRESS	Address_Line_2	Insert	Valid address line
ADDRESS	Address_Line_3	Insert	Valid address line
ADDRESS	Address_Line_4	Insert	Valid address line
ADDRESS	Pincode	Insert	Valid Pincode
ADDRESS	Country	Insert	Valid Country
ADDRESS	Address_start_date	Insert	Valid date (format DDMMYYYY)
•	The above table has the rules and conditions for matching addresses and inserting new records into the ADDRESS table based on the incoming T008 address notifications.
Initial Matching Rules (Incoming File where End Date is not null)
Step	Description
1.3.22	Incoming T008 address notifications are examined.
1.3.23	Address Line 1, Address Line 2, and Pincode are compared with ADDRESS table fields.
1.3.24	If fields match exactly with PAF or Non-PAF compliant address, no new address is created.
1.3.25	If fields do not match exactly, notification file is dropped without exceptions.
Update of Customer Address

Step	Description
1.3.26	Update of Customer Address begins.
1.3.27	For matched records, check against CUSTOMER ADDRESS table. Update if customer's current open RESIDENTIAL address matches the incoming file. Otherwise, file is not processed without warnings or exceptions.
1.3.28	Once ADDRESS table is populated, update CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table.
Conditions for Updating CUSTOMER_ADDRESS Table:

Table	Column	Change	Condition
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS	Address_Key	Update	Points to correct address in ADDRESS table
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS	Cust_Addr_Start_Date	Update	Valid date
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS	Cust_Addr_End_Date	Update	NULL (if address not ended) or valid date (if address ended)
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS	Address_Status_Type	Insert	0 (if address is ended, indicating Dead Letter Office)
Notes:
•	No insertion of address data into Address Lines 2-5 on CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table.
•	For non-PAF compliant addresses, certain fields on CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table remain empty.
•	Triggers update address trace fields with appropriate values for PAF compliant addresses during table update.
QAS Process and De-duplication
•	QAS module runs against new entries in ADDRESS table after CUSTOMER_ADDRESS update.
•	QAS module removes newly created addresses that match existing database addresses, updates CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table to point to original database address.
