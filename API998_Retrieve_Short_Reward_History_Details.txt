API998 - Retrieve Short Reward History Details


Introduction

This Retrieve Short Reward History Details web service retrieves a list of the Open or Open and ended reward data for a particular account including: 

	Full Reward Details (all details)
	Reward
	Reward component.

Pre-Conditions
The calling system must provide a valid account that matches a person record that exists on database.
The calling system must provide a valid Reward key if rewards are to be retrieved based on the reward type. If the reward type is not supplied as input, the reward, reward, reward component data will not be retrieved for the supplied account. 
The calling system must provide the historic flag with a value of true if Open and ended rewards are to be retrieved.


Input
The API will accept the following data:
	AccountNO
	Reward_Key
	Historic flag

Logic
1.	If mandatory data is not supplied, a mandatory data error is raised. If all mandatory data is present, the process continues.
2.	If the format of the supplied Account is valid, it will be used to match records on database. If the account does not exist, a ‘Account not found’ error will be returned.
3.	If a Reward Key or Reward Key(s) are supplied, a check is made to ensure each one’s validity. If not valid, an error will be sent back.
4.	If no Reward Key are supplied, an empty response is sent back, i.e. no Reward or other group tags are returned.
5.	When a account is supplied which exists on database but has no reward / rewards; an empty response is sent back, i.e. no Reward or other group tags are returned.
6.	NULL End Dated Rewards and Future End Dated Rewards only (i.e., not historically closed rewards) pertaining to the requested reward keys will be retrieved.
7.	Rewards will be retrieved in reverse chronological order (descending) by end date first (REWARD_KEY.REWARD_END_DATE) and then in reverse chronological order (descending) by start date second (REWARD_KEY. REWARD_START_DATE).
8.	For the returned Rewards only, return NULL End Dated Rewards and Future End Dated Rewards only (i.e., not historically closed rewards).
9.	No child records of rewards is returned except Reward_Component details.
10.	If the historic flag provided as input is “True” then 
11.	Return all rewards that are open (NULL reward end date).
